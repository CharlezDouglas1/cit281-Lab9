During this lab we were directed to basically go into "GitHub" and go to the Learning Lab to Create a release based workflow

### The assigned task for lab:
- We practiced creating Learning Lab course/repo within our GitHub account
- We practiced practiced exiting and returning to the course from course repo
- We practiced downloading completed course repo as deliverables
